        Welcome to the Genshin Web App, a project born out of passion for web development, data analytics, and the enchanting world of Genshin Impact. This endeavor is a testament to the amalgamation of various web technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the power of SQLite databases. The aim? To craft a versatile and immersive experience for Genshin Impact players while showcasing the endless possibilities of web development.

        At its core, the Genshin Web App serves as a platform for players to submit their wish history data, allowing them to keep a meticulous record of their in-game pulls. But it doesn't stop there. Our project is a testament to the fascinating intersection of gaming and data analytics. Users can harness the app to scrutinize their pull statistics, gain insights into their luck, and delve into the probabilistic aspects of character acquisition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The backbone of this project is a robust SQLite database that seamlessly stores and retrieves player data. Every pull, every character obtained, and every wish used is meticulously logged for further analysis. The project's wish simulator is a testament to the elegant application of probability theory in the gaming world, providing players with a glimpse of what their future pulls might hold.

        Developed entirely by a solo enthusiast, this project reflects the journey of a budding developer with a thirst for knowledge and innovation. As the brainchild of a recent Computer Science graduate named Ryan, it's a testament to what a single determined developer can achieve. From the initial concept to the intricacies of database design, the Genshin Web App showcases the power of individual creativity in the vast realm of web development.
    </p>

    <p>
        The journey doesn't end here. Future plans for this project include cloud-based solutions, enhanced user interfaces, and comprehensive data analytics features. We believe in the potential of this project and its capacity to grow with the gaming community.

        So, join us on this journey into the world of Genshin Impact, web development, and data analytics. This is the Genshin Web Appâ€”a testament to the limitless possibilities that await those who dare to combine their passions and knowledge to create something truly remarkable.
        My name is Ryan, and this is my project.
