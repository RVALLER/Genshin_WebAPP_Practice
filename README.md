Genshin Web App README
Welcome to the Genshin Web App, a platform that allows players to manage and analyze their wish history data in the popular game Genshin Impact. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and future plans.

--- Overview ---
At its core, the Genshin Web App serves as a platform for players to submit their wish history data, enabling them to keep a meticulous record of their in-game pulls. However, our project goes beyond mere record-keeping. It is a fusion of gaming and data analytics, offering users the ability to:

--- Scrutinize their pull statistics ---
Gain insights into their luck
Explore the probabilistic aspects of character acquisition
Database
The backbone of this project is a robust SQLite database that seamlessly stores and retrieves player data. Every pull, character obtained, and wish used is meticulously logged for further analysis. This data forms the foundation for the app's features and analytics.

--- Wish Simulator ---
Our project includes a wish simulator, showcasing the elegant application of probability theory in the gaming world. This simulator provides players with a glimpse of what their future pulls might hold, adding an exciting dimension to their gameplay experience.

--- Developer Story ---
Developed entirely by a solo enthusiast named Ryan, this project reflects the journey of a budding developer with a thirst for knowledge and innovation. From the initial concept to the intricacies of database design, the Genshin Web App exemplifies the power of individual creativity in web development.

--- Future Plans ---
Our journey doesn't end here. We have ambitious plans for the Genshin Web App, including:

Implementing cloud-based solutions for data storage and accessibility
Enhancing the user interface for a more user-friendly experience
Expanding data analytics features to provide even deeper insights
We believe in the potential of this project and its capacity to grow with the gaming community. Join us on this journey into the world of Genshin Impact, web development, and data analytics. The Genshin Web App is a testament to the limitless possibilities that await those who combine their passions and knowledge to create something truly remarkable.
